# Johan-Chan-Scripts
Internship Application

(You will find my scripts in Python, R and Matlab)

Summary :

3BIM : Third year study 

4BIM : Fourth year study



MATLAB :

All Matlab scripts deal with system differential equations as this is why we were using Matlab.


C++ :


-> Boids : It is a bio-inspired script which basically allow you to search the extremum of a non-continuous function of N-dimension by using the property of the birds migration. 


PYTHON :


-> Alignement : It is a script that allow you to calculate how far 2 ADN sequences are between other. Knowing that those 2 sequences are from the same gene but in 2 different genom.
Which means that you can estimate when those 2 genoms started to differ. If you choose the right ADN sequences in 2 species you can roughly speaking, try to estimate
when those 2 species started to differ. 

-> Network : A typical network project we've done. We tried to programme a game call "Targui" in order to allow people to play this game 
in 2 different computer on a local area network.

R :

You will find some of my R scripts I've done during the past 2 year. 
PS : It contains my personnal comments in french. But you do not need to understand them, it is just to remind me what I were doing. 

I will also study Bayesian Inference this semester and I am required to programme a project with the JAGS software. 


If you need more information don't hesitate to let me know.
